# Proposition
**Resolved**: That the US Government should withdraw from the NPT.

# Arguments
## Nuclear weapons are an affordable deterrent
> Nuclear weapons are an affordable deterrent. The cost of the triad represents less than 3 percent of the $526 billion Defense Department budget. In 2012, the U.S. Postal Service lost about $16 billion, or three times the amount it cost U.S. taxpayers for intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers, two-thirds of the triad. Although the nuclear budget needs to rise to offset the more than 20 years of neglect in modernization, a modest increase would barely register in the overall defense budget.

## Wars Cost 4.8 Trillion Dollars
> The United States federal government has spent or obligated 4.8 trillion dollars on the wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. This figure includes: direct Congressional war appropriations; war-related increases to the Pentagon base budget; veterans care and disability; increases in the homeland security budget; interest payments on direct war borrowing; foreign assistance spending; and estimated future obligations for veteransâ€™ care.

## Nuclear weapons are a war deterrent
>  For nuclear deterrence to succeed, a threatening nation has to be capable and willing to use its nuclear weapons and must effectively communicate this to the nation that is to be deterred.

## Gamma rays can be stopped
> To reduce typical gamma rays by a factor of a billion, thicknesses of stop-gammashield need to be about 13.8 feet of water, about 6.6 feet of concrete, or about 1.3 feet of lead. Thick, dense shielding  is necessary to protect against gamma rays. The higher the energy of the gamma ray, the thicker the shield must be. X-rays pose a similar challenge. This is why x-ray technicians often give patients receiving medical or dental X-rays a lead apron to cover other parts of their body.

## Nukes stopped the Cuban Missile Crisis from turning into a war
> Most historians agree that it was precisely because the consequences would have been so terrible, that a nuclear war was avoided. Both sides knew that they had nothing to gain from a missile exchange. They both had time to think about the terrible results of making the wrong move.

# Essay
Many think nuclear weapons are the worlds biggest danger. However, nuclear weapons have many benifits. An example of these benifits is the price. According to [Brown University](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic), The wars in the middle east cost 4.8 trillion dollars. All the nuclear weapons we have cost $5 billion dollars a year. This may still seem like a lot but you have to concider that the US Millitary spent over $1.4 Trillion on a jet that can't even fly (Source: [Time](http://time.com/money/4310099/f-35-budget-pay-free-college-student-loans/)). This means that the cost of a nuculear weapon is not a problem for the United States government. The negative team may say that nuclear weapons could start World War III but you have to remember that nuclear weapons were the only reason the Cold War didn't turn in to World War III was because the USSR and United States knew if they attacked eachother they could be nuked. There is no gain to attacking a country with nuclear weapons. This is because if the country that is being attacked also has nuclear weapons, then that country could fire back causing the country that was attacked first to be destroyed or seriously damaged. According to [nuclearfiles.org](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm), if a war did break out then it would most likely not involve nuclear weapons because of a concept called Mutual Assured Destruction. Mutual Assured Destruction is when a country accives equal nuclear power to its enimies. The senerio I said earlier is an example of what would happen if a country didn't follow the idea of Mutual Assured Destruction. This would be extreamly unlikely because no one wants there country to be destroyed. The idea of Mutual Assured Destruction is why the USSR or US didn't launch their nukes at eachother. This also explains why the US doesn't even need to use its weapons to have the benifit of not being nuked by another country. The negative team might say that allowing the US to use nukes is irrisponsible. However, if the US decided to nuke a country for some reason then its allies or neighbors could start a nuclear or non-nuclear attack. This is similar to how Great Britain got involved in World War I. If you didn't know, Britain got involed in World War II after Germany bombed France by going through Belgium. The negative team may say that they would kill more people if used in warfare than if normal weapons were used. However, according to [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1946/12/if-the-atomic-bomb-had-not-been-used/376238/) there was two B-29 incendiary raids over Tokyo. The first of these raids killed 125,000 people. The latter one killed 100,000 people. Compare this to the 80,000 people killed in Hiroshima and the 45,000 people killed in Nagasaki by the two nuclear bombs. You can see that the second raid killed more then both the nuclear weapons combined. Also, the nukes ended World War II and not the raids. Also, the bomb that hit Hiroshima damaged 15 square miles. The air raid destroyed over 200 square miles of Tokyo. Also, it is likely that if the US didn't use the nuclear weapons, more people would of been killed in World War II. The negative team may say that Nuclear Weapons are more powerful than they were in the 1940s. While this is true, this also makes it less likely that a country will use the nuclear weapons because of the attack they would recive from the country they attacked. Also, countries like North Korea are building nuclear weapons. North Korea is known to be unpredictable and could launch its nuclear weapons at any moment. If North Korea attacks, almost no countries will support them and the US could fire back. In conclusion resolved: That the US Government should withdraw from the NPT.
